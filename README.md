This is a Goodall MultiWare Engineering FrameWork Client program example.

Features include the use of the framework header that contains everything necessary
and links to the framework library. The includes and library are installed where
they need to be by running the sudo-make-install-framework.sh script in the
multiware-framework-and-vpa repository.
